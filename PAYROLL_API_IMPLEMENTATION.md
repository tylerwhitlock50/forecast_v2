# üßæ Payroll API Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive payroll API has been successfully implemented to support the existing payroll management frontend module. This API provides full CRUD operations, cost calculations, forecasting, analytics, and reporting capabilities for payroll management.

## üöÄ What Was Implemented

### 1. API Routes (`app/api/payroll_routes.py`)
A complete FastAPI router with 14 endpoints covering:

#### Employee Management
- `GET /payroll/employees` - List employees with filtering (department, status, business unit)
- `GET /payroll/employees/{employee_id}` - Get specific employee details
- `POST /payroll/employees` - Create new employee
- `PUT /payroll/employees/{employee_id}` - Update existing employee
- `DELETE /payroll/employees/{employee_id}` - Delete employee

#### Configuration Management
- `GET /payroll/config` - Get current payroll configuration (tax rates, benefits)
- `POST /payroll/config` - Update payroll configuration

#### Cost Calculations
- `GET /payroll/calculations/{employee_id}` - Calculate detailed costs for an employee
- `GET /payroll/forecast` - Generate bi-weekly payroll forecast with configurable periods

#### Analytics & Reporting
- `GET /payroll/departments` - Department-level cost analytics
- `GET /payroll/business-units` - Business unit allocation analytics
- `PUT /payroll/employees/{employee_id}/allocations` - Update business unit allocations
- `POST /payroll/bulk-update` - Bulk update multiple employees
- `GET /payroll/reports/summary` - Comprehensive payroll summary report

### 2. Enhanced Database Schema

#### Updated Payroll Table
Enhanced the existing `payroll` table with new fields:
- `department` - Employee department
- `rate_type` - "hourly" or "salary" designation
- `next_review_date` - Scheduled review date
- `expected_raise` - Expected raise amount or percentage
- `benefits_eligible` - Benefits eligibility flag
- `allocations` - JSON field for business unit allocations

#### New Payroll Configuration Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE payroll_config (
    config_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    federal_tax_rate REAL DEFAULT 0.22,
    state_tax_rate REAL DEFAULT 0.06,
    social_security_rate REAL DEFAULT 0.062,
    medicare_rate REAL DEFAULT 0.0145,
    unemployment_rate REAL DEFAULT 0.006,
    benefits_rate REAL DEFAULT 0.25,
    workers_comp_rate REAL DEFAULT 0.015,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 3. Enhanced Data Models (`app/db/models.py`)
Updated Pydantic models to support new functionality:
- `PayrollBase` - Enhanced with all new fields
- `PayrollConfig` / `PayrollConfigCreate` - Tax and benefit rate configuration
- All models include proper validation and type hints

### 4. Sample Data & Templates

#### Enhanced Payroll Data (`data/payroll.csv`)
Updated with realistic sample data including:
- Department assignments
- Rate types (hourly/salary)
- Review dates and expected raises
- Benefits eligibility
- Business unit allocations in JSON format

#### Template Files for Import
- `data/payroll_template.csv` - Template for employee data imports
- `data/payroll_config_template.csv` - Template for configuration imports

### 5. Integration Updates
- Updated `app/main.py` to include the payroll router
- Enhanced `app/db/database.py` to create and load payroll configuration data
- Added automatic migration for existing payroll records

## üîÑ Integration with Frontend

The API is designed to work seamlessly with the existing frontend payroll management module:

### Frontend Components Supported
- `PayrollManagement.js` - Main container with all functionality
- `PayrollForecast.js` - Bi-weekly forecasting and cash flow
- `BusinessUnitAllocation.js` - Allocation management
- `DepartmentAnalytics.js` - Department reporting
- `PayrollReports.js` - Comprehensive reporting
- `PayrollModals.js` - Employee and configuration modals

### Data Flow
1. Frontend calls API endpoints for data retrieval
2. Forms submit data via POST/PUT endpoints
3. Real-time calculations via calculation endpoints
4. Reporting data via analytics endpoints
5. Configuration management via config endpoints

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Configuration

### Database Setup
The database tables are automatically created when the application starts. The migration function will update existing payroll records with new fields.

### CSV Data Loading
Place CSV files in the `data/` directory:
- `payroll.csv` - Employee data
- `payroll_config.csv` - Configuration data

### Default Configuration
Default tax and benefit rates are provided but can be customized via the configuration API.

## üìà Performance Features

- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk update capabilities for multiple employees
- **Configurable Forecasting**: Adjustable forecast periods to control response size
- **Filtered Results**: Optional filtering to reduce data transfer
- **JSON Storage**: Flexible allocation storage without additional tables

## üîí Data Validation

- **Allocation Validation**: Ensures allocations sum to 100%
- **Rate Validation**: Validates reasonable tax and benefit rates
- **Date Validation**: Ensures proper date formats and logic
- **Type Validation**: Strong typing with Pydantic models
- **Business Rule Validation**: Enforces business logic constraints
