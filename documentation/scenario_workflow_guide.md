# Scenario Workflow Guide

This guide walks through the typical workflow for modelling multiple forecasts and comparing them inside the application.

## 1. Create or Duplicate a Scenario
- Open the scenario selector in the top navigation.
- Choose **Duplicate** to branch from an existing scenario or **New Scenario** to start from scratch.
- Each scenario receives a unique `forecast_id` used to scope data across modules.

## 2. Enter Assumptions
- Navigate through the modules (revenue, expenses, payroll, etc.).
- Inline grid editors let you adjust values quickly. Leave `forecast_id` blank to view data from all scenarios or select a scenario to edit its data.

## 3. Compare Scenarios
- Open **Reporting & Analysis → Scenario Comparison**.
- Select multiple scenarios to view key metrics side by side.
- Use this dashboard to spot differences in revenue, expense or payroll assumptions.

## 4. Generate Financial Statements
- Visit **Reporting & Analysis → Financial Reports**.
- Pick one or more scenarios and a reporting period.
- View automatically generated Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement scoped to the chosen scenario(s).

## 5. Iterate
- Continue refining assumptions, duplicating scenarios and comparing results.
- Use the workflow above to model best‑case, worst‑case and expected plans.

This workflow ensures every forecast remains self‑contained while still allowing quick comparisons and consolidated reporting.
