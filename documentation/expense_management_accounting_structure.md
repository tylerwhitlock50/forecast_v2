## Expense Classification Types

### Factory Overhead
- **Purpose**: Costs that support manufacturing operations but cannot be directly traced to specific products
- **Allocation**: Typically allocated to products using predetermined overhead rates
- **Examples**: Utilities for manufacturing, indirect labor, factory supplies
- **Impact**: Increases product costs and affects gross margin calculations

### Administrative Expenses
- **Purpose**: General business operating expenses not related to production
- **Allocation**: Period expenses, not allocated to products
- **Examples**: Office rent, administrative salaries, marketing
- **Impact**: Affects net income but not gross margin

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
- **Purpose**: Direct costs attributable to production
- **Allocation**: Directly traced to specific products or jobs
- **Examples**: Raw materials, direct labor, subcontracting
- **Impact**: Directly affects gross margin and product profitability

## Expense Frequency Types

### Recurring Expenses

| Frequency | Description | Allocation Method | Example |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Weekly | Every 7 days | Immediate or amortized | Temporary labor |
| Monthly | Every month | Immediate or amortized | Rent, utilities |
| Quarterly | Every 3 months | Immediate or amortized over 3 months | Insurance premiums |
| Biannually | Every 6 months | Immediate or amortized over 6 months | Equipment maintenance |
| Annually | Once per year | Immediate or amortized over 12 months | Software licenses |
