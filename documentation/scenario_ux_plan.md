# Scenario UX Improvement Plan

This document outlines the roadmap to make the forecasting application more intuitive and capable of modelling multiple scenarios.

## Plan Overview

1. **Scenario Foundation** – Extend backend models and endpoints to tag expenses, payroll and other tables by `forecast_id`, expose duplication/deletion flows, and update the UI for scenario switching.
2. **Comparative UX** – Build side‑by‑side scenario views with selectable metrics and assumption overrides for quick comparison.
3. **Data Entry Enhancements** – Replace rigid forms with grid or bulk editing, drag‑fill interactions and imports to speed up scenario creation.
4. **Reporting & Documentation** – Deliver scenario‑based financial statements and write onboarding guides for the scenario workflow.
5. **Testing & Polishing** – Add tests for scenario operations and gather feedback through usability sessions.

## Progress

- **Step 1** complete – scenarios can now be duplicated and filtered across expenses and payroll.
- **Step 2** complete – initial comparison endpoint and UI table implemented for side‑by‑side metrics.
- **Step 3** complete – grid‑based editors enable faster expense entry.
- **Step 4** in progress – adding scenario-based financial statements and onboarding docs.
